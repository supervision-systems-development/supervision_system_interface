# Automatic Supervision Application - An interface for a task supervision system. 

This is an application that provides a user-friendly graphical user interface for a supervision syetem. The application ` GUI_For_Supervision_System.ipynb ` launches the interface. The folder ` assets ` is necessary for proper functionality of the application. 

This application uses the supervision system in ` SupervisionSyetem.maude `. 

# Usage

In order to use the application, it is sufficient to launch the file ` GUI_For_Supervision_System.ipynb `, which launches a web server with the application. Some ` .ipynb ` editors immediately launch an instance of the interface in the editor, but it can also be opened from the browser.  The user interface is available from any modern browser at the address of ` https://localhost:8050 `. An arbitrary address can also be defined in the source code of the application.
